glibc NSS module provides integration of these dynamic users/groups into the system's user and group
databases. The user and group name to use may be configured via C<User> and
C<Group> (see above). If these options are not used and dynamic user/group allocation is
enabled for a unit, the name of the dynamic user/group is implicitly derived from the unit name. If the unit
name without the type suffix qualifies as valid user name it is used directly, otherwise a name incorporating a
hash of it is used. If a statically allocated user or group of the configured name already exists, it is used
and no dynamic user/group is allocated. Dynamic users/groups are allocated from the UID/GID range
61184\x{2026}65519. It is recommended to avoid this range for regular system or login users.  At any point in time
each UID/GID from this range is only assigned to zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in
use. However, UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated. Care should be taken that any processes running
as part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by these
users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to

cannot leave files around after unit termination. Moreover C<ProtectSystem=strict> and
C<ProtectHome=read-only> are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file
system locations. In order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they have to be whitelisted
using C<ReadWritePaths>, but care must be taken so that UID/GID recycling doesn't
create security issues involving files created by the service. Use C<RuntimeDirectory> (see

If C<null> is selected, standard input
will be connected to /dev/null, i.e. all
read attempts by the process will result in immediate
EOF.

If C<tty> is selected, standard input is
connected to a TTY (as configured by
C<TTYPath>, see below) and the executed
process becomes the controlling process of the terminal. If
the terminal is already being controlled by another process,
the executed process waits until the current controlling
process releases the terminal.

C<tty-force> is similar to
C<tty>, but the executed process is forcefully
and immediately made the controlling process of the terminal,
potentially removing previous controlling processes from the
terminal.

C<tty-fail> is similar to
C<tty> but if the terminal already has a
controlling process start-up of the executed process
fails.

The C<socket> option is only valid in
socket-activated services, and only when the socket
configuration file (see

set, standard input will be connected to the socket the
service was activated from, which is primarily useful for
compatibility with daemons designed for use with the
traditional
L<inetd(8)>
daemon.

The C<fd> option connects
the input stream to a single file descriptor provided by a socket unit.
A custom named file descriptor can be specified as part of this option,
after a C<:> (e.g. C<fd:foobar>).
If no name is specified, C<stdin> is assumed

At least one socket unit defining such name must be explicitly provided via the

C<inherit> duplicates the file descriptor
of standard input for standard output.

C<null> connects standard output to
/dev/null, i.e. everything written to it
will be lost.

C<tty> connects standard output to a tty
(as configured via C<TTYPath>, see below). If
the TTY is used for output only, the executed process will not
become the controlling process of the terminal, and will not
fail or wait for other processes to release the
terminal.

C<journal> connects standard output with
the journal which is accessible via
L<journalctl(1)>.
Note that everything that is written to syslog or kmsg (see
below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the
specific two options listed below are hence supersets of this
one.

C<syslog> connects standard output to the
L<syslog(3)>
system syslog service, in addition to the journal. Note that
the journal daemon is usually configured to forward everything
it receives to syslog anyway, in which case this option is no
different from C<journal>.

C<kmsg> connects standard output with the
kernel log buffer which is accessible via
L<dmesg(1)>,
in addition to the journal. The journal daemon might be
configured to send all logs to kmsg anyway, in which case this
option is no different from C<journal>.

C<journal+console>,
C<syslog+console> and
C<kmsg+console> work in a similar way as the
three options above but copy the output to the system console
as well.

C<socket> connects standard output to a
socket acquired via socket activation. The semantics are
similar to the same option of
C<StandardInput>.

The C<fd> option connects
the output stream to a single file descriptor provided by a socket unit.
A custom named file descriptor can be specified as part of this option,
after a C<:> (e.g. C<fd:foobar>).
If no name is specified, C<stdout> is assumed
(i.e. C<fd> is equivalent to C<fd:stdout>).
At least one socket unit defining such name must be explicitly provided via the
C<Sockets> option, and file descriptor name may differ
from the name of its containing socket unit.
If multiple matches are found, the first one will be used.
See C<FileDescriptorName> in

for more details about named descriptors and ordering.

If the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal, syslog or the
kernel log buffer, the unit will implicitly gain a dependency of type C<After> on
systemd-journald.socket (also see the automatic dependencies section above).

contain symlinks, they are resolved relative to the root directory set with
C<RootDirectory>.

Paths listed in C<ReadWritePaths> are accessible from within the namespace with the same

Note that strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths of the service

service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable), the error handling logic might
require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure correctly. It
might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of such
failures.

If you specify both types of this option (i.e.
whitelisting and blacklisting), the first encountered will
take precedence and will dictate the default action
(termination or approval of a system call). Then the next
occurrences of this option will add or delete the listed
system calls from the set of the filtered system calls,
depending of its type and the default action. (For example, if
you have started with a whitelisting of
read and write, and
right after it add a blacklisting of
write, then write
will be removed from the set.)

removes C<CAP_SYS_MODULE> from the capability bounding set for

also /usr/lib/modules is made inaccessible. For this
setting the same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges
apply as for C<ReadOnlyPaths> and related calls, see above.
Note that limited automatic module loading due to user configuration or kernel
mapping tables might still happen as side effect of requested user operations,
both privileged and unprivileged. To disable module auto-load feature please see
