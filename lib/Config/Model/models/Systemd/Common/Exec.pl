The following service exit codes are defined by the L<LSB specification|https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_5.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/iniscrptact.html>.



The LSB specification suggests that error codes 200 and above are reserved for implementations. Some of them are
used by the service manager to indicate problems during process invocation:


Finally, the BSD operating systems define a set of exit codes, typically defined on Linux systems too:

recommended to avoid this range for regular system or login users.  At any point in time each UID/GID
from this range is only assigned to zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in use. However,
UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated. Care should be taken that any processes running as
part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by

gain access to these files or directories. If C<DynamicUser> is enabled,
C<RemoveIPC> and C<PrivateTmp> are implied (and cannot be turned
off). This ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed
processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the dynamic
user/group. Since C</tmp/> and C</var/tmp/> are usually the only
world-writable directories on a system this ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group
allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination. Furthermore
C<NoNewPrivileges> and C<RestrictSUIDSGID> are implicitly enabled
(and cannot be disabled), to ensure that processes invoked cannot take benefit or create SUID/SGID
files or directories. Moreover C<ProtectSystem=strict> and
C<ProtectHome=read-only> are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to
arbitrary file system locations. In order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they
have to be allow-listed using C<ReadWritePaths>, but care must be taken so that
UID/GID recycling doesn't create security issues involving files created by the service. Use
C<RuntimeDirectory> (see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a
service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated. Use
C<StateDirectory>, C<CacheDirectory> and
C<LogsDirectory> in order to assign a set of writable directories for specific
purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse (see
below). If this option is enabled, care should be taken that the unit's processes do not get access

part of the unit and stays around as long as the unit is active, to ensure that appropriate actions can be
taken when the unit and hence the PAM session terminates. This process is named C<(sd-pam)> and
is an immediate child process of the unit\'s main process.

Note that when this option is used for a unit it is very likely (depending on PAM configuration) that the
main unit process will be migrated to its own session scope unit when it is activated. This process will hence
be associated with two units: the unit it was originally started from (and for which
C<PAMName> was configured), and the session scope unit. Any child processes of that process
will however be associated with the session scope unit only. This has implications when used in combination
with C<NotifyAccess>C<all>, as these child processes will not be able to affect
changes in the original unit through notification messages. These messages will be considered belonging to the
session scope unit and not the original unit. It is hence not recommended to use C<PAMName> in

details). Note that if no time unit is specified for C<LimitCPU> the default unit of
seconds is implied, while for C<LimitRTTIME> the default unit of microseconds is
implied. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their
enforcement. For example, time limits specified for C<LimitCPU> will be rounded up
implicitly to multiples of 1s. For C<LimitNICE> the value may be specified in two
syntaxes: if prefixed with C<+> or C<->, the value is understood as
regular Linux nice value in the range -20..19. If not prefixed like this the value is understood as
raw resource limit parameter in the range 0..40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).

Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and
processes may fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the
original process, and may thus escape limits set. Also note that C<LimitRSS> is not
implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
controls listed in
L<systemd.resource-control(5)>
over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at
runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, C<MemoryMax> is a more
powerful (and working) replacement for C<LimitRSS>.

For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured
in a user service (i.e. a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be
used to raise the limits above those set for the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as
the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so. In user context these
configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit
to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the
available configuration mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require
privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by
setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager, i.e. the user's

below the locations defined in the following table. Also, the corresponding environment variable will
be defined with the full paths of the directories. If multiple directories are set, then in the
environment variable the paths are concatenated with colon (C<:>).

In case of C<RuntimeDirectory> the innermost subdirectories are removed when
the unit is stopped. It is possible to preserve the specified directories in this case if
C<RuntimeDirectoryPreserve> is configured to C<restart> or
C<yes> (see below). The directories specified with C<StateDirectory>,
C<CacheDirectory>, C<LogsDirectory>,
C<ConfigurationDirectory> are not removed when the unit is stopped.

Except in case of C<ConfigurationDirectory>, the innermost specified directories will be
owned by the user and group specified in C<User> and C<Group>. If the
specified directories already exist and their owning user or group do not match the configured ones, all files
and directories below the specified directories as well as the directories themselves will have their file
ownership recursively changed to match what is configured. As an optimization, if the specified directories are
already owned by the right user and group, files and directories below of them are left as-is, even if they do
not match what is requested. The innermost specified directories will have their access mode adjusted to the
what is specified in C<RuntimeDirectoryMode>, C<StateDirectoryMode>,
C<CacheDirectoryMode>, C<LogsDirectoryMode> and
C<ConfigurationDirectoryMode>.

These options imply C<BindPaths> for the specified paths. When combined with
C<RootDirectory> or C<RootImage> these paths always reside on the host and
are mounted from there into the unit's file system namespace.

If C<DynamicUser> is used in conjunction with
C<StateDirectory>, the logic for C<CacheDirectory> and
C<LogsDirectory> is slightly altered: the directories are created below
C</var/lib/private>, C</var/cache/private> and
C</var/log/private>, respectively, which are host directories made inaccessible to
unprivileged users, which ensures that access to these directories cannot be gained through dynamic
user ID recycling. Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour. Both from
perspective of the host and from inside the unit, the relevant directories hence always appear
directly below C</var/lib>, C</var/cache> and
C</var/log>.

Use C<RuntimeDirectory> to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind
their lifetime to the daemon runtime. This is particularly useful for unprivileged daemons that cannot create
runtime directories in C</run/> due to lack of privileges, and to make sure the runtime
directory is cleaned up automatically after use. For runtime directories that require more complex or different
configuration or lifetime guarantees, please consider using
L<tmpfiles.d(5)>.

The directories defined by these options are always created under the standard paths used by systemd
(C</var/>, C</run/>, C</etc/>, \x{2026}). If the service needs
directories in a different location, a different mechanism has to be used to create them.

L<tmpfiles.d(5)> provides
functionality that overlaps with these options. Using these options is recommended, because the lifetime of
the directories is tied directly to the lifetime of the unit, and it is not necessary to ensure that the
C<tmpfiles.d> configuration is executed before the unit is started.

To remove any of the directories created by these settings, use the systemctl clean
\x{2026} command on the relevant units, see
L<systemctl(1)> for
details.

Example: if a system service unit has the following,

    RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar baz

the service manager creates C</run/foo> (if it does not exist),
C</run/foo/bar>, and C</run/baz>. The
directories C</run/foo/bar> and
C</run/baz> except C</run/foo> are
owned by the user and group specified in C<User> and C<Group>, and removed
when the service is stopped.

Example: if a system service unit has the following,

    RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar
    StateDirectory=aaa/bbb ccc

then the environment variable C<RUNTIME_DIRECTORY> is set with C</run/foo/bar>, and

In case of C<RuntimeDirectory> the innermost subdirectories are removed when
the unit is stopped. It is possible to preserve the specified directories in this case if
C<RuntimeDirectoryPreserve> is configured to C<restart> or
C<yes> (see below). The directories specified with C<StateDirectory>,
C<CacheDirectory>, C<LogsDirectory>,
C<ConfigurationDirectory> are not removed when the unit is stopped.

Except in case of C<ConfigurationDirectory>, the innermost specified directories will be
owned by the user and group specified in C<User> and C<Group>. If the
specified directories already exist and their owning user or group do not match the configured ones, all files
and directories below the specified directories as well as the directories themselves will have their file
ownership recursively changed to match what is configured. As an optimization, if the specified directories are
already owned by the right user and group, files and directories below of them are left as-is, even if they do
not match what is requested. The innermost specified directories will have their access mode adjusted to the
what is specified in C<RuntimeDirectoryMode>, C<StateDirectoryMode>,
C<CacheDirectoryMode>, C<LogsDirectoryMode> and
C<ConfigurationDirectoryMode>.

These options imply C<BindPaths> for the specified paths. When combined with
C<RootDirectory> or C<RootImage> these paths always reside on the host and
are mounted from there into the unit's file system namespace.

If C<DynamicUser> is used in conjunction with
C<StateDirectory>, the logic for C<CacheDirectory> and
C<LogsDirectory> is slightly altered: the directories are created below
C</var/lib/private>, C</var/cache/private> and
C</var/log/private>, respectively, which are host directories made inaccessible to
unprivileged users, which ensures that access to these directories cannot be gained through dynamic
user ID recycling. Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour. Both from
perspective of the host and from inside the unit, the relevant directories hence always appear
directly below C</var/lib>, C</var/cache> and
C</var/log>.

Use C<RuntimeDirectory> to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind
their lifetime to the daemon runtime. This is particularly useful for unprivileged daemons that cannot create
runtime directories in C</run/> due to lack of privileges, and to make sure the runtime
directory is cleaned up automatically after use. For runtime directories that require more complex or different
configuration or lifetime guarantees, please consider using
L<tmpfiles.d(5)>.

The directories defined by these options are always created under the standard paths used by systemd
(C</var/>, C</run/>, C</etc/>, \x{2026}). If the service needs
directories in a different location, a different mechanism has to be used to create them.

L<tmpfiles.d(5)> provides
functionality that overlaps with these options. Using these options is recommended, because the lifetime of
the directories is tied directly to the lifetime of the unit, and it is not necessary to ensure that the
C<tmpfiles.d> configuration is executed before the unit is started.

To remove any of the directories created by these settings, use the systemctl clean
\x{2026} command on the relevant units, see
L<systemctl(1)> for
details.

Example: if a system service unit has the following,

    RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar baz

the service manager creates C</run/foo> (if it does not exist),
C</run/foo/bar>, and C</run/baz>. The
directories C</run/foo/bar> and
C</run/baz> except C</run/foo> are
owned by the user and group specified in C<User> and C<Group>, and removed
when the service is stopped.

    RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar
    StateDirectory=aaa/bbb ccc

desired, because it is not possible to nest C<ReadWritePaths>, C<ReadOnlyPaths>,
C<BindPaths>, or C<BindReadOnlyPaths> inside it. For a more flexible option,
see C<TemporaryFileSystem>.

Non-directory paths may be specified as well. These options may be specified more than once,
in which case all paths listed will have limited access from within the namespace. If the empty string is
assigned to this option, the specific list is reset, and all prior assignments have no effect.

Paths in C<ReadWritePaths>, C<ReadOnlyPaths> and
C<InaccessiblePaths> may be prefixed with C<->, in which case they will be
ignored when they do not exist. If prefixed with C<+> the paths are taken relative to the root
directory of the unit, as configured with C<RootDirectory>/C<RootImage>,
instead of relative to the root directory of the host (see above). When combining C<-> and
C<+> on the same path make sure to specify C<-> first, and C<+>
second.

Note that these settings will disconnect propagation of mounts from the unit\'s processes to the
host. This means that this setting may not be used for services which shall be able to install mount points in
the main mount namespace. For C<ReadWritePaths> and C<ReadOnlyPaths>
propagation in the other direction is not affected, i.e. mounts created on the host generally appear in the
unit processes\' namespace, and mounts removed on the host also disappear there too. In particular, note that
mount propagation from host to unit will result in unmodified mounts to be created in the unit\'s namespace,
i.e. writable mounts appearing on the host will be writable in the unit\'s namespace too, even when propagated
below a path marked with C<ReadOnlyPaths>! Restricting access with these options hence does
not extend to submounts of a directory that are created later on. This means the lock-down offered by that
setting is not complete, and does not offer full protection.

Note that the effect of these settings may be undone by privileged processes. In order to set up an
effective sandboxed environment for a unit it is thus recommended to combine these settings with either

C<SystemCallFilter=~@mount>.',

points. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list is reset, and all prior assignments have no effect.

other resources owned by users/groups not equaling C<root> or the unit\'s own will stay visible
from within the unit but appear owned by the C<nobody> user and group. If this mode is enabled,
all unit processes are run without privileges in the host user namespace (regardless if the unit\'s own
user/group is C<root> or not). Specifically this means that the process will have zero process
capabilities on the host\'s user namespace, but full capabilities within the service\'s user namespace. Settings

additional capabilities in the host\'s user namespace. Defaults to off.

When turned on, this executes three operations for each invoked process: a new

propagation in the opposite direction in effect). Finally, the mounts are remounted again to the propagation
mode configured with C<MountFlags>, see below.

File system namespaces are set up individually for each process forked off by the service manager. Mounts
established in the namespace of the process created by C<ExecStartPre> will hence be cleaned
up automatically as soon as that process exits and will not be available to subsequent processes forked off for

for details on mount propagation, and the three propagation flags in particular.

This setting only controls the final propagation setting in effect on all mount
points of the file system namespace created for each process of this unit. Other file system namespacing unit
settings (see the discussion in C<PrivateMounts> above) will implicitly disable mount and
unmount propagation from the unit's processes towards the host by changing the propagation setting of all mount
points in the unit's file system namespace to C<slave> first. Setting this option to

merged. If the empty string is assigned, the filter is reset, all prior assignments will have no

Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off
alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this
option. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this option with
C<SystemCallArchitectures=native> or similar.

Note that strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths of the service
invocation. Specifically, access to the execve() system call is required for the execution
of the service binary \x{2014} if it is blocked service invocation will necessarily fail. Also, if execution of the
service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable), the error handling logic might
require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure correctly. It
might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of such
failures.

If you specify both types of this option (i.e.  allow-listing and deny-listing), the first
encountered will take precedence and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a
system call). Then the next occurrences of this option will add or delete the listed system calls
from the set of the filtered system calls, depending of its type and the default action. (For
example, if you have started with an allow list rule for read() and
write(), and right after it add a deny list rule for write(),
then write() will be removed from the set.)

As the number of possible system calls is large, predefined sets of system calls are provided.  A set
starts with C<\@> character, followed by name of the set.

This is the recommended starting point for allow-listing system calls for system services, as it contains what is typically needed by system services, but excludes overly specific interfaces. For example, the following APIs are excluded: C<\@clock>, C<\@mount>, C<\@swap>, C<\@reboot>.\@timerSystem calls for scheduling operations by time (L<alarm(2)>, L<timer_create(2)>, \x{2026})\@knownAll system calls defined by the kernel. This list is defined statically in systemd based on a kernel version that was available when this systemd version was released. It will become progressively more out-of-date as the kernel is updated.
Note, that as new system calls are added to the kernel, additional system calls might be added to the groups
above. Contents of the sets may also change between systemd versions. In addition, the list of system calls
depends on the kernel version and architecture for which systemd was compiled. Use
systemd-analyze\x{a0}syscall-filter to list the actual list of system calls in each
filter.

Generally, allow-listing system calls (rather than deny-listing) is the safer mode of
operation. It is recommended to enforce system call allow lists for all long-running system
services. Specifically, the following lines are a relatively safe basic choice for the majority of
system services:

Note that various kernel system calls are defined redundantly: there are multiple system calls
for executing the same operation. For example, the pidfd_send_signal() system
call may be used to execute operations similar to what can be done with the older
kill() system call, hence blocking the latter without the former only provides
weak protection. Since new system calls are added regularly to the kernel as development progresses,
keeping system call deny lists comprehensive requires constant work. It is thus recommended to use
allow-listing instead, which offers the benefit that new system calls are by default implicitly
blocked until the allow list is updated.

Also note that a number of system calls are required to be accessible for the dynamic linker to
work. The dynamic linker is required for running most regular programs (specifically: all dynamic ELF
binaries, which is how most distributions build packaged programs). This means that blocking these
system calls (which include open(), openat() or
mmap()) will make most programs typically shipped with generic distributions
unusable.

It is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with
C<SystemCallFilter=~\@mount>, in order to prohibit the unit's processes to undo the
mappings. Specifically these are the options C<PrivateTmp>,
C<PrivateDevices>, C<ProtectSystem>, C<ProtectHome>,

C<NoNewPrivileges=yes> is implied. By default, this option is set to the empty list, i.e. no

If this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system calls, and
system calls of the specified architectures. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is treated
as including x86-64 system calls. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as explained below, on
x32.

System call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures. For example, on x86
filtering of network socket-related calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations \x{2014} a limitation that x86-64
does not have, however. On systems supporting multiple ABIs at the same time \x{2014} such as x86/x86-64 \x{2014} it is hence
recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures so that secondary ABIs may not be used to
circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system. In particular, setting
C<SystemCallArchitectures=native> is a good choice for disabling non-native ABIs.

If C<null> is selected, standard input will be connected to C</dev/null>,
i.e. all read attempts by the process will result in immediate EOF.

If C<tty> is selected, standard input is connected to a TTY (as configured by
C<TTYPath>, see below) and the executed process becomes the controlling process of the
terminal. If the terminal is already being controlled by another process, the executed process waits until the
current controlling process releases the terminal.

C<tty-force> is similar to C<tty>, but the executed process is forcefully and
immediately made the controlling process of the terminal, potentially removing previous controlling processes
from the terminal.

C<tty-fail> is similar to C<tty>, but if the terminal already has a
controlling process start-up of the executed process fails.

The C<data> option may be used to configure arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via
standard input to the executed process. The data to pass is configured via
C<StandardInputText>/C<StandardInputData> (see below). Note that the actual
file descriptor type passed (memory file, regular file, UNIX pipe, \x{2026}) might depend on the kernel and available
privileges. In any case, the file descriptor is read-only, and when read returns the specified data followed by
EOF.

The C<file:path> option may be used to connect a specific file
system object to standard input. An absolute path following the C<:> character is expected,
which may refer to a regular file, a FIFO or special file. If an C<AF_UNIX> socket in the
file system is specified, a stream socket is connected to it. The latter is useful for connecting standard
input of processes to arbitrary system services.

The C<socket> option is valid in socket-activated services only, and requires the relevant
socket unit file (see

to have C<Accept=yes> set, or to specify a single socket only. If this option is set, standard
input will be connected to the socket the service was activated from, which is primarily useful for

daemon.

C<journal>, C<kmsg>, C<journal+console>,
C<kmsg+console>, C<file:path>,
C<append:path>, C<socket> or
C<fd:name>.

C<inherit> duplicates the file descriptor of standard input for standard output.

C<null> connects standard output to C</dev/null>, i.e. everything written
to it will be lost.

C<tty> connects standard output to a tty (as configured via C<TTYPath>,
see below). If the TTY is used for output only, the executed process will not become the controlling process of
the terminal, and will not fail or wait for other processes to release the terminal.

C<journal> connects standard output with the journal, which is accessible via
L<journalctl(1)>. Note
that everything that is written to kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the
specific option listed below is hence a superset of this one. (Also note that any external,
additional syslog daemons receive their log data from the journal, too, hence this is the option to
use when logging shall be processed with such a daemon.)

C<kmsg> connects standard output with the kernel log buffer which is accessible via
L<dmesg(1)>,
in addition to the journal. The journal daemon might be configured to send all logs to kmsg anyway, in which
case this option is no different from C<journal>.

C<journal+console> and C<kmsg+console> work in a similar way as the
two options above but copy the output to the system console as well.

The C<file:path> option may be used to connect a specific file
system object to standard output. The semantics are similar to the same option of
C<StandardInput>, see above. If path refers to a regular file
on the filesystem, it is opened (created if it doesn\'t exist yet) for writing at the beginning of the file,
but without truncating it.
If standard input and output are directed to the same file path, it is opened only once, for reading as well
as writing and duplicated. This is particularly useful when the specified path refers to an
C<AF_UNIX> socket in the file system, as in that case only a
single stream connection is created for both input and output.

C<append:path> is similar to
C<file:path> above, but it opens the file in append mode.

C<socket> connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation. The
semantics are similar to the same option of C<StandardInput>, see above.

The C<fd:name> option connects standard output to a specific,
named file descriptor provided by a socket unit.  A name may be specified as part of this option, following a
C<:> character (e.g. C<fd:foobar>).  If no name is specified, the name
C<stdout> is implied (i.e. C<fd> is equivalent to
C<fd:stdout>).  At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided via the
C<Sockets> option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing
socket unit.  If multiple matches are found, the first one will be used.  See
C<FileDescriptorName> in
L<systemd.socket(5)> for more
details about named descriptors and their ordering.

If the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal or
the kernel log buffer, the unit will implicitly gain a dependency of type C<After>
on C<systemd-journald.socket> (also see the "Implicit Dependencies" section
above). Also note that in this case stdout (or stderr, see below) will be an
C<AF_UNIX> stream socket, and not a pipe or FIFO that can be re-opened. This means
when executing shell scripts the construct echo "hello" > /dev/stderr for
writing text to stderr will not work. To mitigate this use the construct echo "hello"
>&2 instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids this pitfall.

that may be passed to unit processes. They are primarily used for passing cryptographic keys (both
public and private) or certificates, user account information or identity information from host to
services. The data is accessible from the unit\'s processes via the file system, at a read-only
location that (if possible and permitted) is backed by non-swappable memory. The data is only
accessible to the user associated with the unit, via the
C<User>/C<DynamicUser> settings (as well as the superuser). When
available, the location of credentials is exported as the C<$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY>
environment variable to the unit\'s processes.

The C<LoadCredential> setting takes a textual ID to use as name for a
credential plus a file system path. The ID must be a short ASCII string suitable as filename in the
filesystem, and may be chosen freely by the user. If the specified path is absolute it is opened as
regular file and the credential data is read from it. If the absolute path refers to an
C<AF_UNIX> stream socket in the file system a connection is made to it (only once
at unit start-up) and the credential data read from the connection, providing an easy IPC integration
point for dynamically providing credentials from other services. If the specified path is not
absolute and itself qualifies as valid credential identifier it is understood to refer to a
credential that the service manager itself received via the C<$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY>
environment variable, which may be used to propagate credentials from an invoking environment (e.g. a
container manager that invoked the service manager) into a service. The contents of the file/socket
may be arbitrary binary or textual data, including newline characters and C<NUL>
bytes. This option may be used multiple times, each time defining an additional credential to pass to
the unit.

The credential files/IPC sockets must be accessible to the service manager, but don\'t have to
be directly accessible to the unit\'s processes: the credential data is read and copied into separate,
read-only copies for the unit that are accessible to appropriately privileged processes. This is
particularly useful in combination with C<DynamicUser> as this way privileged data
can be made available to processes running under a dynamic UID (i.e. not a previously known one)
without having to open up access to all users.

In order to reference the path a credential may be read from within a
C<ExecStart> command line use C<${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred>,
e.g. C<ExecStart=cat ${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred>.

Currently, an accumulated credential size limit of 1M bytes per unit is
enforced.

If referencing an C<AF_UNIX> stream socket to connect to, the connection will
originate from an abstract namespace socket, that includes information about the unit and the
credential ID in its socket name. Use L<getpeername(2)>
to query this information. The returned socket name is formatted as C<NUL>RANDOM C</unit/> UNITC</> ID, i.e. a C<NUL> byte (as required
for abstract namespace socket names), followed by a random string (consisting of alphadecimal
characters), followed by the literal string C</unit/>, followed by the requesting
unit name, followed by the literal character C</>, followed by the textual credential
ID requested. Example: C<\\0adf9d86b6eda275e/unit/foobar.service/credx> in case the
credential C<credx> is requested for a unit C<foobar.service>. This
