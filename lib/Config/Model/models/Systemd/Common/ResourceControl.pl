interfaces that processes of this unit can use. By default processes can only use the network interfaces
listed (allow-list). If the first character of the rule is C<~>, the effect is inverted:
the processes can only use network interfaces not listed (deny-list).

This option can appear multiple times, in which case the network interface names are merged. If the
empty string is assigned the set is reset, all prior assignments will have not effect.

If you specify both types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first encountered
will take precedence and will dictate the default action (allow vs deny). Then the next occurrences of this
option will add or delete the listed network interface names from the set, depending of its type and the
default action.

The loopback interface ("lo") is not treated in any special way, you have to configure it explicitly
in the unit file.

Example 1: allow-list


    RestrictNetworkInterfaces=eth1
    RestrictNetworkInterfaces=eth2

Programs in the unit will be only able to use the eth1 and eth2 network
interfaces.

Example 2: deny-list


    RestrictNetworkInterfaces=~eth1 eth2

Programs in the unit will be able to use any network interface but eth1 and eth2.

Example 3: mixed


    RestrictNetworkInterfaces=eth1 eth2
    RestrictNetworkInterfaces=~eth1

Programs in the unit will be only able to use the eth2 network interface.

easily and this in turn allows more fine grained filtering. NFT rules for cgroup matching use
numeric cgroup IDs, which change every time a service is restarted, making them hard to use in
systemd environment otherwise. Dynamic and random IDs used by C<DynamicUser> can
be also integrated with this setting.

This option expects a whitespace separated list of NFT set definitions. Each definition
consists of a colon-separated tuple of source type (one of C<cgroup>,
C<user> or C<group>), NFT address family (one of
C<arp>, C<bridge>, C<inet>, C<ip>,
C<ip6>, or C<netdev>), table name and set name. The names of tables
and sets must conform to lexical restrictions of NFT table names. The type of the element used in
the NFT filter must match the type implied by the directive (C<cgroup>,
C<user> or C<group>) as shown in the table below. When a control
group or a unit is realized, the corresponding ID will be appended to the NFT sets and it will be
be removed when the control group or unit is removed. systemd only inserts
elements to (or removes from) the sets, so the related NFT rules, tables and sets must be prepared
elsewhere in advance. Failures to manage the sets will be ignored.

If the firewall rules are reinstalled so that the contents of NFT sets are destroyed, command
systemctl daemon-reload can be used to refill the sets.

Example:

unit. (This generalizes the functionality exposed via C<IPEgressFilterPath> and
C<IPIngressFilterPath> for other hooks.)  Cgroup-bpf hooks in the form of BPF
programs loaded to the BPF filesystem are attached with cgroup-bpf attach flags determined by the
unit. For details about attachment types and flags see
L<C<bpf.h>|https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h>. Also
refer to the general L<BPF documentation|https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/>.

The specification of BPF program consists of a pair of BPF program type and program path in
the file system, with C<:> as the separator:
type:program-path.

The BPF program type is equivalent to the BPF attach type used in
L<bpftool(8)>
It may be one of
C<egress>,
C<ingress>,
C<sock_create>,
C<sock_ops>,
C<device>,
C<bind4>,
C<bind6>,
C<connect4>,
C<connect6>,

C<post_bind6>,
C<sendmsg4>,
C<sendmsg6>,
C<sysctl>,
C<recvmsg4>,
C<recvmsg6>,
C<getsockopt>,
or C<setsockopt>.

The specified program path must be an absolute path referencing a BPF program inode in the
bpffs file system (which generally means it must begin with C</sys/fs/bpf/>). If
a specified program does not exist (i.e. has not been uploaded to the BPF subsystem of the kernel
yet), it will not be installed but unit activation will continue (a warning will be printed to the
logs).

Setting C<BPFProgram> to an empty value makes previous assignments
ineffective.

Multiple assignments of the same program type/path pair have the same effect as a single
assignment: the program will be attached just once.

If BPF C<egress> pinned to program-path path is already being
handled by C<IPEgressFilterPath>, C<BPFProgram>
assignment will be considered valid and C<BPFProgram> will be attached to a cgroup.
Similarly for C<ingress> hook and C<IPIngressFilterPath> assignment.

BPF programs passed with C<BPFProgram> are attached to the cgroup of a unit
with BPF attach flag C<multi>, that allows further attachments of the same
type within cgroup hierarchy topped by the unit cgroup.

strings: a device node specifier followed by a combination of C<r>,
C<w>, C<m> to control reading,
writing, or creation of the specific device nodes by the unit
(mknod), respectively. This functionality is implemented using eBPF
filtering.

When access to all physical devices should be disallowed,
C<PrivateDevices> may be used instead. See
L<systemd.exec(5)>.

The device node specifier is either a path to a device node in the file system, starting with
C</dev/>, or a string starting with either C<char-> or
C<block-> followed by a device group name, as listed in
C</proc/devices>. The latter is useful to allow-list all current and future
devices belonging to a specific device group at once. The device group is matched according to
filename globbing rules, you may hence use the C<*> and C<?>
wildcards. (Note that such globbing wildcards are not available for device node path
specifications!) In order to match device nodes by numeric major/minor, use device node paths in
the C</dev/char/> and C</dev/block/> directories. However,
matching devices by major/minor is generally not recommended as assignments are neither stable nor
portable between systems or different kernel versions.

Examples: C</dev/sda5> is a path to a device node, referring to an ATA or
SCSI block device. C<char-pts> and C<char-alsa> are specifiers for
all pseudo TTYs and all ALSA sound devices, respectively. C<char-cpu/*> is a
specifier matching all CPU related device groups.

Note that allow lists defined this way should only reference device groups which are
resolvable at the time the unit is started. Any device groups not resolvable then are not added to
the device allow list. In order to work around this limitation, consider extending service units
with a pair of After=modprobe\@xyz.service and
Wants=modprobe\@xyz.service lines that load the necessary kernel module
implementing the device group if missing.
Example:
    \x{2026}

unit implies the parent slice, it is hence redundant to ever

C<User> setting) the unit\'s control group will be made accessible to the relevant
user.

When enabled the service manager will refrain from manipulating control groups or moving
processes below the unit\'s control group, so that a clear concept of ownership is established: the
control group tree at the level of the unit\'s control group and above (i.e. towards the root
control group) is owned and managed by the service manager of the host, while the control group
tree below the unit\'s control group is owned and managed by the unit itself.

Takes either a boolean argument or a (possibly empty) list of control group controller names.
If true, delegation is turned on, and all supported controllers are enabled for the unit, making
them available to the unit\'s processes for management. If false, delegation is turned off entirely
(and no additional controllers are enabled). If set to a list of controllers, delegation is turned
on, and the specified controllers are enabled for the unit. Assigning the empty string will enable
delegation, but reset the list of controllers, and all assignments prior to this will have no
effect. Note that additional controllers other than the ones specified might be made available as
well, depending on configuration of the containing slice unit or other units contained in it.
Defaults to false.

Note that controller delegation to less privileged code is only safe on the unified control
group hierarchy. Accordingly, access to the specified controllers will not be granted to
unprivileged services on the legacy hierarchy, even when requested.

Not all of these controllers are available on all kernels however, and some are specific to
the unified hierarchy while others are specific to the legacy hierarchy. Also note that the kernel
might support further controllers, which aren\'t covered here yet as delegation is either not
supported at all for them or not defined cleanly.

Note that because of the hierarchical nature of cgroup hierarchy, any controllers that are
delegated will be enabled for the parent and sibling units of the unit with delegation.
