of configuration options for resource control of spawned processes. Internally, this relies on the Linux Control
Groups (cgroups) kernel concept for organizing processes in a hierarchical tree of named groups for the purpose of
resource management.
This man page lists the configuration options shared by
those six unit types. See
L<systemd.unit(5)>
for the common options of all unit configuration files, and
L<systemd.slice(5)>,
L<systemd.scope(5)>,
L<systemd.service(5)>,
L<systemd.socket(5)>,
L<systemd.mount(5)>,
and
L<systemd.swap(5)>
for more information on the specific unit configuration files. The
resource control configuration options are configured in the
[Slice], [Scope], [Service], [Socket], [Mount], or [Swap]
sections, depending on the unit type.
In addition, options which control resources available to programs
executed by systemd are listed in
L<systemd.exec(5)>.
Those options complement options listed here.
See the New
Control Group Interfaces for an introduction on how to make
use of resource control APIs from programs.
This configuration class was generated from systemd documentation.
