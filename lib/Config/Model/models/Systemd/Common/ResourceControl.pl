Groups (cgroups) kernel concept for organizing processes in a hierarchical tree of named groups for the purpose of
resource management.

This man page lists the configuration options shared by
those six unit types. See
L<systemd.unit(5)>
for the common options of all unit configuration files, and
L<systemd.slice(5)>,
L<systemd.scope(5)>,
L<systemd.service(5)>,
L<systemd.socket(5)>,
L<systemd.mount(5)>,
and
L<systemd.swap(5)>
for more information on the specific unit configuration files. The
resource control configuration options are configured in the
[Slice], [Scope], [Service], [Socket], [Mount], or [Swap]
sections, depending on the unit type.

In addition, options which control resources available to programs
executed by systemd are listed in
L<systemd.exec(5)>.
Those options complement options listed here.

See the L<New
Control Group Interfaces|https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/ControlGroupInterface/> for an introduction on how to make
use of resource control APIs from programs.

strings: a device node specifier followed by a combination of C<r>,
C<w>, C<m> to control reading,
writing, or creation of the specific device node(s) by the unit
(mknod), respectively. On cgroup-v1 this controls the
C<devices.allow> control group attribute. For details about this control group
attribute, see L<Device Whitelist Controller|https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/devices.html>.
In the unified cgroup hierarchy this functionality is implemented using eBPF filtering.

The device node specifier is either a path to a device node in the file system, starting with
C</dev/>, or a string starting with either C<char-> or
C<block-> followed by a device group name, as listed in
C</proc/devices>. The latter is useful to allow-list all current and future
devices belonging to a specific device group at once. The device group is matched according to
filename globbing rules, you may hence use the C<*> and C<?>
wildcards. (Note that such globbing wildcards are not available for device node path
specifications!) In order to match device nodes by numeric major/minor, use device node paths in
the C</dev/char/> and C</dev/block/> directories. However,
matching devices by major/minor is generally not recommended as assignments are neither stable nor
portable between systems or different kernel versions.

Examples: C</dev/sda5> is a path to a device node, referring to an ATA or
SCSI block device. C<char-pts> and C<char-alsa> are specifiers for
all pseudo TTYs and all ALSA sound devices, respectively. C<char-cpu/*> is a
specifier matching all CPU related device groups.

Note that allow lists defined this way should only reference device groups which are
resolvable at the time the unit is started. Any device groups not resolvable then are not added to
the device allow list. In order to work around this limitation, consider extending service units
with a pair of After=modprobe\@xyz.service and
Wants=modprobe\@xyz.service lines that load the necessary kernel module
implementing the device group if missing.
Example:
    \x{2026}
    [Unit]
    Wants=modprobe\@loop.service
    After=modprobe\@loop.service

control group will be made accessible to the relevant user. When enabled the service manager will refrain
from manipulating control groups or moving processes below the unit\'s control group, so that a clear concept
of ownership is established: the control group tree above the unit\'s control group (i.e. towards the root
control group) is owned and managed by the service manager of the host, while the control group tree below
the unit\'s control group is owned and managed by the unit itself. Takes either a boolean argument or a list
of control group controller names. If true, delegation is turned on, and all supported controllers are
enabled for the unit, making them available to the unit\'s processes for management. If false, delegation is
turned off entirely (and no additional controllers are enabled). If set to a list of controllers, delegation
is turned on, and the specified controllers are enabled for the unit. Note that additional controllers than
the ones specified might be made available as well, depending on configuration of the containing slice unit

specific to the unified hierarchy while others are specific to the legacy hierarchy. Also note that the
