L<systemd.swap(5)>,
L<systemd.mount(5)>
and

each unit type.

The kill procedure configuration options are configured in
the [Service], [Socket], [Mount] or [Swap] section, depending on
the unit type.
This configuration class was generated from systemd documentation.

If set to C<control-group>, all remaining
processes in the control group of this unit will be killed on
unit stop (for services: after the stop command is executed,
as configured with C<ExecStop>). If set to
C<process>, only the main process itself is
killed. If set to C<mixed>, the
C<SIGTERM> signal (see below) is sent to the
main process while the subsequent C<SIGKILL>
signal (see below) is sent to all remaining processes of the
unit\'s control group. If set to C<none>, no
process is killed. In this case, only the stop command will be
executed on unit stop, but no process be killed otherwise.
Processes remaining alive after stop are left in their control
group and the control group continues to exist after stop
unless it is empty.

Processes will first be terminated via
C<SIGTERM> (unless the signal to send is
changed via C<KillSignal>). Optionally, this
is immediately followed by a C<SIGHUP> (if
enabled with C<SendSIGHUP>). If then, after a
delay (configured via the C<TimeoutStopSec>
option), processes still remain, the termination request is
repeated with the C<SIGKILL> signal (unless
this is disabled via the C<SendSIGKILL>
option). See
L<kill(2)>
for more information.
