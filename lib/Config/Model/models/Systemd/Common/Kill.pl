The kill procedure configuration options are configured in
the [Service], [Socket], [Mount] or [Swap] section, depending on
the unit type.
This configuration class was generated from systemd documentation.

C<control-group>, C<mixed>, C<process>,
C<none>.

If set to C<control-group>, all remaining processes in the control group of this
unit will be killed on unit stop (for services: after the stop command is executed, as configured
with C<ExecStop>). If set to C<mixed>, the
C<SIGTERM> signal (see below) is sent to the main process while the subsequent
C<SIGKILL> signal (see below) is sent to all remaining processes of the unit\'s
control group. If set to C<process>, only the main process itself is killed (not
recommended!). If set to C<none>, no process is killed (strongly recommended
against!). In this case, only the stop command will be executed on unit stop, but no process will be
killed otherwise.  Processes remaining alive after stop are left in their control group and the
control group continues to exist after stop unless empty.

Note that it is not recommended to set C<KillMode> to
C<process> or even C<none>, as this allows processes to escape
the service manager\'s lifecycle and resource management, and to remain running even while their
service is considered stopped and is assumed to not consume any resources.

Processes will first be terminated via C<SIGTERM> (unless the signal to send
is changed via C<KillSignal> or C<RestartKillSignal>). Optionally,
this is immediately followed by a C<SIGHUP> (if enabled with
C<SendSIGHUP>). If processes still remain after the main process of a unit has
exited or the delay configured via the C<TimeoutStopSec> has passed, the termination
request is repeated with the C<SIGKILL> signal or the signal specified via
C<FinalKillSignal> (unless this is disabled via the C<SendSIGKILL>
option). See L<kill(2)>
for more information.
