C<.socket> encodes information about an IPC or
network socket or a file system FIFO controlled and supervised by
systemd, for socket-based activation.

This man page lists the configuration options specific to
this unit type. See
L<systemd.unit(5)>
for the common options of all unit configuration files. The common
configuration items are configured in the generic [Unit] and
[Install] sections. The socket specific configuration options are
configured in the [Socket] section.

Additional options are listed in
L<systemd.exec(5)>,
which define the execution environment the
C<ExecStartPre>, C<ExecStartPost>,
C<ExecStopPre> and C<ExecStopPost>
commands are executed in, and in
L<systemd.kill(5)>,
which define the way the processes are terminated, and in
L<systemd.resource-control(5)>,
which configure resource control settings for the processes of the
socket.

For each socket unit, a matching service unit must exist,
describing the service to start on incoming traffic on the socket
(see
L<systemd.service(5)>
for more information about .service units). The name of the
.service unit is by default the same as the name of the .socket
unit, but can be altered with the C<Service> option
described below. Depending on the setting of the
C<Accept> option described below, this .service
unit must either be named like the .socket unit, but with the
suffix replaced, unless overridden with C<Service>;
or it must be a template unit named the same way. Example: a
socket file C<foo.socket> needs a matching
service C<foo.service> if
C<Accept=no> is set. If
C<Accept=yes> is set, a service template
C<foo@.service> must exist from which services
are instantiated for each incoming connection.

No implicit C<WantedBy> or
C<RequiredBy> dependency from the socket to the
service is added. This means that the service may be started
without the socket, in which case it must be able to open sockets
by itself. To prevent this, an explicit
C<Requires> dependency may be added.

Socket units may be used to implement on-demand starting of
services, as well as parallelized starting of services. See the
blog stories linked at the end for an introduction.

Note that the daemon software configured for socket activation with socket units needs to be able
to accept sockets from systemd, either via systemd\'s native socket passing interface (see
L<sd_listen_fds(3)> for
details about the precise protocol used and the order in which the file descriptors are passed) or via
traditional L<inetd(8)>-style
socket passing (i.e. sockets passed in via standard input and output, using
C<StandardInput=socket> in the service file).

All network sockets allocated through C<.socket> units are allocated in the host\'s network
namespace (see L<network_namespaces(7)>). This
does not mean however that the service activated by a configured socket unit has to be part of the host\'s network
namespace as well.  It is supported and even good practice to run services in their own network namespace (for
example through C<PrivateNetwork>, see
L<systemd.exec(5)>), receiving only
the sockets configured through socket-activation from the host\'s namespace. In such a set-up communication within
the host\'s network namespace is only permitted through the activation sockets passed in while all sockets allocated
from the service code itself will be associated with the service\'s own namespace, and thus possibly subject to a
restrictive configuration.
This configuration class was generated from systemd documentation.

(C<@>), it is read as abstract namespace
socket in the C<AF_UNIX> family. The
C<@> is replaced with a
C<NUL> character before binding. For
details, see
L<unix(7)>.

If the address string is a single number, it is read as
port number to listen on via IPv6. Depending on the value of
C<BindIPv6Only> (see below) this might result
in the service being available via both IPv6 and IPv4
(default) or just via IPv6.

If the address string is a string in the format
C<v.w.x.y:z>, it is interpreted
as IPv4 address v.w.x.y and port z.

If the address string is a string in the format
C<[x]:y>, it is interpreted as
IPv6 address x and port y. An optional
interface scope (interface name or number) may be specified after a C<%> symbol:
C<[x]:y%dev>.
Interface scopes are only useful with link-local addresses, because the kernel ignores them in other
cases. Note that if an address is specified as IPv6, it might still make the service available via
IPv4 too, depending on the C<BindIPv6Only> setting (see below).

If the address string is a string in the format
C<vsock:x:y>, it is read as CID
x on a port y address in the

C<AF_VSOCK> analogous to an IP address.  Specifying the CID is optional, and may be
