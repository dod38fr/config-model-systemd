    'class_description' => 'A unit configuration file whose name ends in
C<.socket> encodes information about an IPC or
network socket or a file system FIFO controlled and supervised by
systemd, for socket-based activation.

This man page lists the configuration options specific to
this unit type. See
L<systemd.unit(5)>
for the common options of all unit configuration files. The common
configuration items are configured in the generic C<[Unit]> and
C<[Install]> sections. The socket specific configuration options are
configured in the C<[Socket]> section.

Additional options are listed in
L<systemd.exec(5)>,
which define the execution environment the
C<ExecStartPre>, C<ExecStartPost>,
C<ExecStopPre> and C<ExecStopPost>
commands are executed in, and in
L<systemd.kill(5)>,
which define the way the processes are terminated, and in
L<systemd.resource-control(5)>,
which configure resource control settings for the processes of the
socket.

For each socket unit, a matching service unit must exist,
describing the service to start on incoming traffic on the socket
(see
L<systemd.service(5)>
for more information about .service units). The name of the
.service unit is by default the same as the name of the .socket
unit, but can be altered with the C<Service> option
described below. Depending on the setting of the
C<Accept> option described below, this .service
unit must either be named like the .socket unit, but with the
suffix replaced, unless overridden with C<Service>;
or it must be a template unit named the same way. Example: a
socket file foo.socket needs a matching
service foo.service if
C<Accept=no> is set. If
C<Accept=yes> is set, a service template
foo@.service must exist from which services
are instantiated for each incoming connection.

No implicit C<WantedBy> or
C<RequiredBy> dependency from the socket to the
service is added. This means that the service may be started
without the socket, in which case it must be able to open sockets
by itself. To prevent this, an explicit
C<Requires> dependency may be added.

Socket units may be used to implement on-demand starting of
services, as well as parallelized starting of services. See the
blog stories linked at the end for an introduction.

Note that the daemon software configured for socket
activation with socket units needs to be able to accept sockets
from systemd, either via systemd\'s native socket passing interface
(see
L<sd_listen_fds(3)>
for details) or via the traditional
L<inetd(8)>-style
socket passing (i.e. sockets passed in via standard input and
output, using C<StandardInput=socket> in the
service file).

All network sockets allocated through .socket units are allocated in the host\'s network
namespace (see L<network_namespaces(7)>). This
does not mean however that the service activated by a configured socket unit has to be part of the host\'s network
namespace as well.  It is supported and even good practice to run services in their own network namespace (for
example through C<PrivateNetwork>, see
L<systemd.exec(5)>), receiving only
the sockets configured through socket-activation from the host\'s namespace. In such a set-up communication within
the host\'s network namespace is only permitted through the activation sockets passed in while all sockets allocated
from the service code itself will be associated with the service\'s own namespace, and thus possibly subject to a a
much more restrictive configuration.
This configuration class was generated from systemd documentation.

and the kernel will ignore initial ACK packets without any
data. The argument specifies the approximate amount of time
the kernel should wait for incoming data before falling back
to the normal behavior of honoring empty ACK packets. This
option is beneficial for protocols where the client sends the
data first (e.g. HTTP, in contrast to SMTP), because the
server process will not be woken up unnecessarily before it
can take any action.

If the client also uses the
C<TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT> option, the latency of
the initial connection may be reduced, because the kernel will
send data in the final packet establishing the connection (the
third packet in the "three-way handshake").
