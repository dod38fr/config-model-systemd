This man page lists the configuration options specific to
this unit type. See
L<systemd.unit(5)>
for the common options of all unit configuration files. The common
configuration items are configured in the generic
C<[Unit]> and C<[Install]>
sections. The service specific configuration options are
configured in the C<[Service]> section.

Additional options are listed in
L<systemd.exec(5)>,
which define the execution environment the commands are executed
in, and in
L<systemd.kill(5)>,
which define the way the processes of the service are terminated,
and in
L<systemd.resource-control(5)>,
which configure resource control settings for the processes of the
service.

If a service is requested under a certain name but no unit
configuration file is found, systemd looks for a SysV init script
by the same name (with the .service suffix
removed) and dynamically creates a service unit from that script.
This is useful for compatibility with SysV. Note that this
compatibility is quite comprehensive but not 100%. For details
about the incompatibilities, see the Incompatibilities
with SysV document.
This configuration class was generated from systemd documentation.

service unit. One of
C<simple>,
C<forking>,
C<oneshot>,
C<dbus>,
C<notify> or
C<idle>.

If set to C<simple> (the default if
neither C<Type> nor
C<BusName>, but C<ExecStart>
are specified), it is expected that the process configured
with C<ExecStart> is the main process of the
service. In this mode, if the process offers functionality to
other processes on the system, its communication channels
should be installed before the daemon is started up (e.g.
sockets set up by systemd, via socket activation), as systemd
will immediately proceed starting follow-up units.

If set to C<forking>, it is expected that
the process configured with C<ExecStart> will
call fork() as part of its start-up. The
parent process is expected to exit when start-up is complete
and all communication channels are set up. The child continues
to run as the main daemon process. This is the behavior of
traditional UNIX daemons. If this setting is used, it is
recommended to also use the C<PIDFile>
option, so that systemd can identify the main process of the
daemon. systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units as
soon as the parent process exits.

Behavior of C<oneshot> is similar to
C<simple>; however, it is expected that the
process has to exit before systemd starts follow-up units.
C<RemainAfterExit> is particularly useful for
this type of service. This is the implied default if neither
C<Type> nor C<ExecStart> are
specified.

Behavior of C<dbus> is similar to
C<simple>; however, it is expected that the
daemon acquires a name on the D-Bus bus, as configured by
C<BusName>. systemd will proceed with
starting follow-up units after the D-Bus bus name has been
acquired. Service units with this option configured implicitly
gain dependencies on the dbus.socket
unit. This type is the default if C<BusName>
is specified.

Behavior of C<notify> is similar to
C<simple>; however, it is expected that the
daemon sends a notification message via
L<sd_notify(3)>
or an equivalent call when it has finished starting up.
systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units after this
notification message has been sent. If this option is used,
C<NotifyAccess> (see below) should be set to
open access to the notification socket provided by systemd. If
C<NotifyAccess> is missing or set to
C<none>, it will be forcibly set to
C<main>. Note that currently
C<Type>C<notify> will not work
if used in combination with
C<PrivateNetwork>C<yes>.

Behavior of C<idle> is very similar to C<simple>; however, actual execution
of the service program is delayed until all active jobs are dispatched. This may be used to avoid interleaving
of output of shell services with the status output on the console. Note that this type is useful only to
improve console output, it is not useful as a general unit ordering tool, and the effect of this service type
is subject to a 5s time-out, after which the service program is invoked anyway.',

remaining for it are terminated

L<systemd.kill(5)>).
If this option is not specified, the process is terminated by
sending the signal specified in C<KillSignal>
when service stop is requested. Specifier and environment
variable substitution is supported (including
C<$MAINPID>, see above).

Note that it is usually not sufficient to specify a command for this setting that only asks the service
to terminate (for example, by queuing some form of termination signal for it), but does not wait for it to do
so. Since the remaining processes of the services are killed according to C<KillMode> and
C<KillSignal> as described above immediately after the command exited, this may not result in
a clean stop. The specified command should hence be a synchronous operation, not an asynchronous one.

Note that the commands specified in C<ExecStop> are only executed when the service
started successfully first. They are not invoked if the service was never started at all, or in case its
start-up failed, for example because any of the commands specified in C<ExecStart>,
C<ExecStartPre> or C<ExecStartPost> failed (and weren\'t prefixed with
C<->, see above) or timed out. Use C<ExecStopPost> to invoke commands when a
service failed to start up correctly and is shut down again. Also note that, service restart requests are
implemented as stop operations followed by start operations. This means that C<ExecStop> and
C<ExecStopPost> are executed during a service restart operation.

It is recommended to use this setting for commands that communicate with the service requesting clean
termination. When the commands specified with this option are executed it should be assumed that the service is
