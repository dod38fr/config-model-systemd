    'class_description' => "A unit configuration file encodes information about a
service, a socket, a device, a mount point, an automount point, a
swap file or partition, a start-up target, a watched file system
path, a timer controlled and supervised by
L<systemd(1)>,
a resource management slice or
a group of externally created processes. The syntax is inspired by
XDG
Desktop Entry Specification .desktop
files, which are in turn inspired by Microsoft Windows
.ini files.

This man page lists the common configuration options of all
the unit types. These options need to be configured in the [Unit]
or [Install] sections of the unit files.

In addition to the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections
described here, each unit may have a type-specific section, e.g.
[Service] for a service unit. See the respective man pages for
more information:
L<systemd.service(5)>,
L<systemd.socket(5)>,
L<systemd.device(5)>,
L<systemd.mount(5)>,
L<systemd.automount(5)>,
L<systemd.swap(5)>,
L<systemd.target(5)>,
L<systemd.path(5)>,
L<systemd.timer(5)>,
L<systemd.slice(5)>,
L<systemd.scope(5)>.


Various settings are allowed to be specified more than once,
in which case the interpretation depends on the setting. Often,
multiple settings form a list, and setting to an empty value
\"resets\", which means that previous assignments are ignored. When
this is allowed, it is mentioned in the description of the
setting. Note that using multiple assignments to the same value
makes the unit file incompatible with parsers for the XDG
.desktop file format.

Unit files are loaded from a set of paths determined during
compilation, described in the next section.

Unit files may contain additional options on top of those
listed here. If systemd encounters an unknown option, it will
write a warning log message but continue loading the unit. If an
option or section name is prefixed with C<X->, it is
ignored completely by systemd. Options within an ignored section
do not need the prefix. Applications may use this to include
additional information in the unit files.

Boolean arguments used in unit files can be written in
various formats. For positive settings the strings
C<1>, C<yes>, C<true>
and C<on> are equivalent. For negative settings, the
strings C<0>, C<no>,
C<false> and C<off> are
equivalent.

Time span values encoded in unit files can be written in various formats. A stand-alone
number specifies a time in seconds.  If suffixed with a time unit, the unit is honored. A
concatenation of multiple values with units is supported, in which case the values are added
up. Example: C<50> refers to 50 seconds; C<2min\x{a0}200ms> refers to
2 minutes and 200 milliseconds, i.e. 120200\x{a0}ms.  The following time units are understood:
C<s>, C<min>, C<h>, C<d>,
C<w>, C<ms>, C<us>.  For details see
L<systemd.time(7)>.

Empty lines and lines starting with C<#> or C<;> are
ignored. This may be used for commenting. Lines ending in a backslash are concatenated with the
following line while reading and the backslash is replaced by a space character. This may be
used to wrap long lines.

Units can be aliased (have an alternative name), by creating a symlink from the new name
to the existing name in one of the unit search paths. For example,
systemd-networkd.service has the alias
dbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service, created during installation as the
symlink /usr/lib/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service. In
addition, unit files may specify aliases through the C<Alias> directive in the
[Install] section; those aliases are only effective when the unit is enabled. When the unit is
enabled, symlinks will be created for those names, and removed when the unit is disabled. For
example, reboot.target specifies
C<Alias=ctrl-alt-del.target>, so when enabled it will be invoked whenever
CTRL+ALT+DEL is pressed. Alias names may be used in commands like enable,
disable, start, stop,
status, \x{2026}, and in unit dependency directives C<Wants>,
C<Requires>, C<Before>, C<After>, \x{2026}, with the
limitation that aliases specified through C<Alias> are only effective when the
unit is enabled. Aliases cannot be used with the preset command.

Along with a unit file foo.service, the directory
foo.service.wants/ may exist. All unit files symlinked from such a
directory are implicitly added as dependencies of type C<Wants> to the unit.
This is useful to hook units into the start-up of other units, without having to modify their
unit files. For details about the semantics of C<Wants>, see below. The
preferred way to create symlinks in the .wants/ directory of a unit file is
with the enable command of the
L<systemctl(1)>
tool which reads information from the [Install] section of unit files (see below). A similar
functionality exists for C<Requires> type dependencies as well, the directory
suffix is .requires/ in this case.

Along with a unit file foo.service, a \"drop-in\" directory
foo.service.d/ may exist. All files with the suffix
C<.conf> from this directory will be parsed after the file itself is
parsed. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings for a unit, without having to
modify unit files. Each drop-in file must have appropriate section headers. Note that for
instantiated units, this logic will first look for the instance C<.d/>
subdirectory and read its C<.conf> files, followed by the template
C<.d/> subdirectory and the C<.conf> files there. Also note that
settings from the C<[Install]> section are not honored in drop-in unit files,
and have no effect.

In addition to /etc/systemd/system, the drop-in C<.d>
directories for system services can be placed in /usr/lib/systemd/system or
/run/systemd/system directories. Drop-in files in /etc
take precedence over those in /run which in turn take precedence over those
in /usr/lib. Drop-in files under any of these directories take precedence
over unit files wherever located.

Some unit names reflect paths existing in the file system
namespace. Example: a device unit
dev-sda.device refers to a device with the
device node /dev/sda in the
file system namespace. If this applies, a special way to escape
the path name is used, so that the result is usable as part of a
filename. Basically, given a path, \"/\" is replaced by \"-\", and all
other characters which are not ASCII alphanumerics are replaced by
C-style \"\\x2d\" escapes (except that \"_\" is never replaced and \".\"
is only replaced when it would be the first character in the
escaped path). The root directory \"/\" is encoded as single dash,
while otherwise the initial and ending \"/\" are removed from all
paths during transformation. This escaping is reversible. Properly
escaped paths can be generated using the
L<systemd-escape(1)>
command.

Optionally, units may be instantiated from a
template file at runtime. This allows creation of
multiple units from a single configuration file. If
systemd looks for a unit configuration file, it will
first search for the literal unit name in the
file system. If that yields no success and the unit
name contains an C<\@> character, systemd will look for a
unit template that shares the same name but with the
instance string (i.e. the part between the C<\@> character
and the suffix) removed. Example: if a service
getty\@tty3.service is requested
and no file by that name is found, systemd will look
for getty\@.service and
instantiate a service from that configuration file if
it is found.

To refer to the instance string from within the
configuration file you may use the special C<%i>
specifier in many of the configuration options. See below for
details.

If a unit file is empty (i.e. has the file size 0) or is
symlinked to /dev/null, its configuration
will not be loaded and it appears with a load state of
C<masked>, and cannot be activated. Use this as an
effective way to fully disable a unit, making it impossible to
start it even manually.

The unit file format is covered by the
Interface
Stability Promise.

Additional units might be loaded into systemd (\"linked\")
from directories not on the unit load path. See the
link command for
L<systemctl(1)>.
Also, some units are dynamically created via a
L<systemd.generator(7)>.
