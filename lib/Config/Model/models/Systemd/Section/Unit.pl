target, a watched file system path, a timer controlled and supervised by
L<systemd(1)>, a
resource management slice or a group of externally created processes. See
L<systemd.syntax(5)>
for a general description of the syntax.

This man page lists the common configuration options of all
the unit types. These options need to be configured in the [Unit]
or [Install] sections of the unit files.

In addition to the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections
described here, each unit may have a type-specific section, e.g.
[Service] for a service unit. See the respective man pages for
more information:
L<systemd.service(5)>,
L<systemd.socket(5)>,
L<systemd.device(5)>,
L<systemd.mount(5)>,
L<systemd.automount(5)>,
L<systemd.swap(5)>,
L<systemd.target(5)>,
L<systemd.path(5)>,
L<systemd.timer(5)>,
L<systemd.slice(5)>,
L<systemd.scope(5)>.


Unit files are loaded from a set of paths determined during compilation, described in the next
section.

Valid unit names consist of a \"name prefix\" and a dot and a suffix specifying the unit type. The
\"unit prefix\" must consist of one or more valid characters (ASCII letters, digits, C<:>,
C<->, C<_>, C<.>, and C<\\>). The total
length of the unit name including the suffix must not exceed 256 characters. The type suffix must be one
of C<.service>, C<.socket>, C<.device>,
C<.mount>, C<.automount>, C<.swap>,
C<.target>, C<.path>, C<.timer>,
C<.slice>, or C<.scope>.

Units names can be parameterized by a single argument called the \"instance name\". The unit is then
constructed based on a \"template file\" which serves as the definition of multiple services or other
units. A template unit must have a single C<\@> at the end of the name (right before the
type suffix). The name of the full unit is formed by inserting the instance name between
C<\@> and the unit type suffix. In the unit file itself, the instance parameter may be
referred to using C<%i> and other specifiers, see below.

Unit files may contain additional options on top of those
listed here. If systemd encounters an unknown option, it will
write a warning log message but continue loading the unit. If an
option or section name is prefixed with C<X->, it is
ignored completely by systemd. Options within an ignored section
do not need the prefix. Applications may use this to include
additional information in the unit files.

Units can be aliased (have an alternative name), by creating a symlink from the new name to the
existing name in one of the unit search paths. For example, C<systemd-networkd.service>
has the alias C<dbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service>, created during installation as
a symlink, so when systemd is asked through D-Bus to load
C<dbus-org.freedesktop.network1.service>, it'll load
C<systemd-networkd.service>. As another example, C<default.target> \x{2014}
the default system target started at boot \x{2014} is commonly symlinked (aliased) to either
C<multi-user.target> or C<graphical.target> to select what is started
by default. Alias names may be used in commands like disable,
start, stop, status, and similar, and in all
unit dependency directives, including C<Wants>, C<Requires>,
C<Before>, C<After>. Aliases cannot be used with the
preset command.

Aliases obey the following restrictions: a unit of a certain type (C<.service>,
C<.socket>, \x{2026}) can only be aliased by a name with the same type suffix. A plain unit (not
a template or an instance), may only be aliased by a plain name. A template instance may only be aliased
by another template instance, and the instance part must be identical. A template may be aliased by
another template (in which case the alias applies to all instances of the template). As a special case, a
template instance (e.g. C<alias\@inst.service>) may be a symlink to different template
(e.g. C<template\@inst.service>). In that case, just this specific instance is aliased,
while other instances of the template (e.g. C<alias\@foo.service>,
C<alias\@bar.service>) are not aliased. Those rule preserve the requirement that the
instance (if any) is always uniquely defined for a given unit and all its aliases.

Unit files may specify aliases through the C<Alias> directive in the [Install]
section. When the unit is enabled, symlinks will be created for those names, and removed when the unit is
disabled. For example, C<reboot.target> specifies
C<Alias=ctrl-alt-del.target>, so when enabled, the symlink
C</etc/systemd/systemd/ctrl-alt-del.service> pointing to the
C<reboot.target> file will be created, and when
CtrlAltDel is invoked,
systemd will look for the C<ctrl-alt-del.service> and execute
C<reboot.service>. systemd does not look at the [Install] section at
all during normal operation, so any directives in that section only have an effect through the symlinks
created during enablement.

Along with a unit file C<foo.service>, the directory
C<foo.service.wants/> may exist. All unit files symlinked from such a directory are
implicitly added as dependencies of type C<Wants> to the unit. Similar functionality
exists for C<Requires> type dependencies as well, the directory suffix is
C<.requires/> in this case. This functionality is useful to hook units into the
start-up of other units, without having to modify their unit files. For details about the semantics of
C<Wants>, see below. The preferred way to create symlinks in the
C<.wants/> or C<.requires/> directory of a unit file is by embedding
the dependency in [Install] section of the target unit, and creating the symlink in the file system with
the enable or preset commands of
L<systemctl(1)>.

Along with a unit file C<foo.service>, a \"drop-in\" directory
C<foo.service.d/> may exist. All files with the suffix C<.conf> from this
directory will be parsed after the unit file itself is parsed. This is useful to alter or add configuration
settings for a unit, without having to modify unit files. Drop-in files must contain appropriate section
headers. For instantiated units, this logic will first look for the instance C<.d/> subdirectory
(e.g. C<foo\@bar.service.d/>) and read its C<.conf> files, followed by the template
C<.d/> subdirectory (e.g. C<foo\@.service.d/>) and the C<.conf>
files there. Moreover for units names containing dashes (C<->), the set of directories generated by
truncating the unit name after all dashes is searched too. Specifically, for a unit name
C<foo-bar-baz.service> not only the regular drop-in directory
C<foo-bar-baz.service.d/> is searched but also both C<foo-bar-.service.d/> and
C<foo-.service.d/>. This is useful for defining common drop-ins for a set of related units, whose
names begin with a common prefix. This scheme is particularly useful for mount, automount and slice units, whose
systematic naming structure is built around dashes as component separators. Note that equally named drop-in files
further down the prefix hierarchy override those further up,
i.e. C<foo-bar-.service.d/10-override.conf> overrides
C<foo-.service.d/10-override.conf>.

In cases of unit aliases (described above), dropins for the aliased name and all aliases are
loaded. In the example of C<default.target> aliasing
C<graphical.target>, C<default.target.d/>,
C<default.target.wants/>, C<default.target.requires/>,
C<graphical.target.d/>, C<graphical.target.wants/>,
C<graphical.target.requires/> would all be read. For templates, dropins for the
template, any template aliases, the template instance, and all alias instances are read. When just a
specific template instance is aliased, then the dropins for the target template, the target template
instance, and the alias template instance are read.

In addition to C</etc/systemd/system>, the drop-in C<.d/>
directories for system services can be placed in C</usr/lib/systemd/system> or
C</run/systemd/system> directories. Drop-in files in C</etc>
take precedence over those in C</run> which in turn take precedence over those
in C</usr/lib>. Drop-in files under any of these directories take precedence
over unit files wherever located. Multiple drop-in files with different names are applied in
lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in.

Units also support a top-level drop-in with C<type.d/>,
where type may be e.g. C<service> or C<socket>,
that allows altering or adding to the settings of all corresponding unit files on the system.
The formatting and precedence of applying drop-in configurations follow what is defined above.
Configurations in C<type.d/> have the lowest precedence
compared to settings in the name specific override directories. So the contents of
C<foo-.service.d/10-override.conf> would override
C<service.d/10-override.conf>.

Note that while systemd offers a flexible dependency system
between units it is recommended to use this functionality only
sparingly and instead rely on techniques such as bus-based or
socket-based activation which make dependencies implicit,
resulting in a both simpler and more flexible system.

As mentioned above, a unit may be instantiated from a template file. This allows creation
of multiple units from a single configuration file. If systemd looks for a unit configuration
file, it will first search for the literal unit name in the file system. If that yields no
success and the unit name contains an C<\@> character, systemd will look for a
unit template that shares the same name but with the instance string (i.e. the part between the
C<\@> character and the suffix) removed. Example: if a service
C<getty\@tty3.service> is requested and no file by that name is found, systemd
will look for C<getty\@.service> and instantiate a service from that
configuration file if it is found.

To refer to the instance string from within the
configuration file you may use the special C<%i>
specifier in many of the configuration options. See below for
details.

If a unit file is empty (i.e. has the file size 0) or is
symlinked to C</dev/null>, its configuration
will not be loaded and it appears with a load state of
C<masked>, and cannot be activated. Use this as an
effective way to fully disable a unit, making it impossible to
start it even manually.

The unit file format is covered by the
L<Interface
Stability Promise|https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/InterfaceStabilityPromise>.

The set of load paths for the user manager instance may be augmented or
changed using various environment variables. And environment variables may in
turn be set using environment generators, see
L<systemd.environment-generator(7)>.
In particular, C<\$XDG_DATA_HOME> and
C<\$XDG_DATA_DIRS> may be easily set using
L<systemd-environment-d-generator(8)>.
Thus, directories listed here are just the defaults. To see the actual list that
would be used based on compilation options and current environment use


+-+systemd-analyze --user unit-paths



Moreover, additional units might be loaded into systemd from
directories not on the unit load path by creating a symlink pointing to a
unit file in the directories. You can use systemctl link
for this operation. See
L<systemctl(1)>
for its usage and precaution.


Unit files may also include a number of C<Condition\x{2026}=> and
C<Assert\x{2026}=> settings. Before the unit is started, systemd will verify
that the specified conditions are true. If not, the starting of the unit will be (mostly silently)
skipped. Failing conditions will not result in the unit being moved into the C<failed>
state. The conditions are checked at the time the queued start job is to be executed. The ordering
dependencies are still respected, so other units are still pulled in and ordered as if this unit was
successfully activated. Use condition expressions in order to skip units that do not apply to the local
system, for example because the kernel or runtime environment doesn't require their functionality.


If multiple conditions are specified, the unit will be executed if all of them apply (i.e. a
logical AND is applied). Condition checks can use a pipe symbol (C<|>) after the equals
sign (C<Condition\x{2026}=|\x{2026}>), which causes the condition becomes a triggering condition. If
at least one triggering condition is defined for a unit, then the unit will be executed if at least one
of the triggering conditions apply and all of the non-triggering conditions. If you prefix an argument
with the pipe symbol and an exclamation mark, the pipe symbol must be passed first, the exclamation
second. If any of these options is assigned the empty string, the list of conditions is reset
completely, all previous condition settings (of any kind) will have no effect.

The C<AssertArchitecture>, C<AssertVirtualization>, \x{2026} options
provide a similar mechanism that causes the job to fail (instead of being skipped). The failed check is
logged. Units with failed conditions are considered to be in a clean state and will be garbage
collected if they are not referenced. This means that when queried, the condition failure may or may
not show up in the state of the unit.

Note that neither assertion nor condition expressions result in unit state changes. Also note
that both are checked at the time the job is to be executed, i.e. long after depending jobs and it
itself were queued. Thus, neither condition nor assertion expressions are suitable for conditionalizing
unit dependencies.

The condition verb of
L<systemd-analyze(1)> can
be used to test condition and assert expressions.

Except for C<ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink>, all path checks follow symlinks.

Units can suddenly, unexpectedly enter inactive state for different reasons: the main process of a service unit
might terminate on its own choice, the backing device of a device unit might be unplugged or the mount point of
a mount unit might be unmounted without involvement of the system and service manager.

When used in conjunction with C<After> on the same unit the behaviour of
