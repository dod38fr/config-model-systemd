C<.timer> encodes information about a timer
controlled and supervised by systemd, for timer-based
activation.

This man page lists the configuration options specific to
this unit type. See
L<systemd.unit(5)>
for the common options of all unit configuration files. The common
configuration items are configured in the generic [Unit] and
[Install] sections. The timer specific configuration options are
configured in the [Timer] section.

For each timer file, a matching unit file must exist,
describing the unit to activate when the timer elapses. By
default, a service by the same name as the timer (except for the
suffix) is activated. Example: a timer file
foo.timer activates a matching service
foo.service. The unit to activate may be
controlled by C<Unit> (see below).

Note that in case the unit to activate is already active at the time the timer elapses it is not restarted,
but simply left running. There is no concept of spawning new service instances in this case. Due to this, services
with C<RemainAfterExit> set (which stay around continuously even after the service\'s main process
exited) are usually not suitable for activation via repetitive timers, as they will only be activated once, and
then stay around forever.
This configuration class was generated from systemd documentation.

configured in seconds. Example: "OnBootSec=50" means 50s after
boot-up. The argument may also include time units. Example:

congestion. Note the relation to
C<AccuracySec> above: the latter allows the

time range in order to minimize wakeups, the former does the
opposite: it stretches timer events over a time range, to make
it unlikely that they fire simultaneously. If

the randomized delay is added, and then the result is
possibly further shifted to coalesce it with other timer
events happening on the system. As mentioned above

coalescing of timer events. In order to optimally stretch
