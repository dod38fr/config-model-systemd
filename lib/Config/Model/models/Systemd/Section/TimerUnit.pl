interval is a time span with the default unit of seconds, but other
units may be specified, see

be set to 0 to disable any kind of rate limiting. burst is a number and

These configuration options are particularly useful in conjunction with the service setting
C<Restart> (see
L<systemd.service(5)>);
however, they apply to all kinds of starts (including manual), not just those triggered by the
C<Restart> logic.

Note that units which are configured for C<Restart>, and which reach the start
limit are not attempted to be restarted anymore; however, they may still be restarted manually or
from a timer or socket at a later point, after the interval has passed.
From that point on, the restart logic is activated again. systemctl reset-failed
will cause the restart rate counter for a service to be flushed, which is useful if the administrator
wants to manually start a unit and the start limit interferes with that. Rate-limiting is enforced
after any unit condition checks are executed, and hence unit activations with failing conditions do
not count towards the rate limit.

When a unit is unloaded due to the garbage collection logic (see above) its rate limit counters
are flushed out too. This means that configuring start rate limiting for a unit that is not
referenced continuously has no effect.
