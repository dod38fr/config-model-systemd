manually at a later point, after the interval has passed.  From this point on, the
restart logic is activated again. Note that systemctl reset-failed will cause the restart
rate counter for a service to be flushed, which is useful if the administrator wants to manually start a unit
and the start limit interferes with that. Note that this rate-limiting is enforced after any unit condition
checks are executed, and hence unit activations with failing conditions do not count towards this rate
limit. This setting does not apply to slice, target, device, and scope units, since they are unit types whose
activation may either never fail, or may succeed only a single time.
